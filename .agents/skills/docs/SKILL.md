# Docs

When working in the `xulbux` repository, any AI agent or automated assistant MUST adhere strictly to the following rules regarding documentation, docstrings, and code comments.

## 1. Docstrings

### General Rules

1.  **Mandatory Policy:** Follow `AGENTS.md` Section 6 for library-wide mandatory documentation requirements.
2.  **Private Constants & Caches:** Document private constants and module-level variables (placed directly below imports per `AGENTS.md` Section 5) with a concise docstring.
3.  **Parameters (`__init__` vs Classes):** For classes that take parameters, document the parameters in the **class's docstring**. Do NOT add a docstring to the `__init__` method itself. (This ensures params are displayed in the signature of the class in the docs).
4.  **Parameters List:** Docstrings for signatures that have params MUST list those params in the exact same order as the signature, **without type-hints**, and quickly describe what each param is for.
5.  **Returns & Yields:** Do **NOT** describe the return/yield value unless it is special, complex, or cannot be inferred from the type hinting.
6.  **Exceptions:** If a function/method raises special exceptions for specific reasons, describe that in the docstring.
7.  **Attributes & Properties:** Document public class/instance attributes or properties directly below their variable/property definitions, *not* in the class docstring (see `console.ArgumentParser` for an example).
8.  **Examples:** Always add one or more example usages if the function/class is large or quite complicated to understand.

### Formatting & Line Wraps

1.  **Spacing After Docstring:** There must ALWAYS be exactly **ONE empty line** between a docstring and the following code/content of a function, method, or class.
    *   **Exception (Adjacent Variable & Attribute Definitions):** When documenting a sequence of variables, constants, or class attributes (e.g., class attributes in classes, `NamedTuple`s, `dataclass`es, `TypedDict`s, `__init__` attributes, or grouped type aliases/constants), do **NOT** place an empty line between an attribute's docstring and the next adjacent attribute definition. Each attribute and its docstring must form a tight, contiguous block on adjacent lines.
    *   **Visual Grouping via Section Separators:** To organize and visually separate distinct logical categories or clusters of constants/attributes (e.g., standard colors vs. namespaces, or character sets by type), use **internal section separators** (65 characters wide) rather than bare empty lines. The section separator naturally has an empty line before and after it, providing clean, labeled visual separation while keeping all attributes within each section contiguous.
2.  **Text Width:** The content of a docstring MUST be wrapped to a maximum width of **99 characters**.
3.  **Line Breaks:** Do **NOT** use `<br>` to artificially wrap long lines inside a continuous sentence. Only use `<br>` when a **new sentence** starts on a new line, or after a `:` where the following content is supposed to start on a new line (and isn't a bullet point, since those are on a new line naturally). Use `\n` if there should be a larger space (like a paragraph break) after the wrap.
4.  **Horizontal Rules (HRs):** HRs (`----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`) must ALWAYS be exactly **100 characters** long, regardless of how wide the text content is.
5.  **HR Padding:** If the next line is a HR, the current line must end in `\n` to prevent rendering glitches.
6.  **Quotes Placement:** For all functions, methods, classes, and attributes, the first line of docstring content MUST start immediately on the same line as the opening `"""` (e.g., `"""A short description…`), never on a new line below it. Similarly, the closing `"""` MUST be placed directly at the end of the last line of content on the same line (e.g., `…end of content."""`), never on its own separate line below it. (See [Module Docstrings](#module-docstrings) below for the only exception).
7.  **Styling & Tags:**
    *   **Bold:** Use Markdown `**bold text**`.
    *   **Italics:** Do **NOT** use italics (it breaks in some IDEs).
    *   **Inline Code/Expressions:** Use backticks `` ` `` for variables, expression parts, and inline code.
    *   **Ellipsis Character:** Always use the single Unicode character `…` instead of three dots `...` in docstrings, comments, and documentation text (follow `AGENTS.md` Section 5 for full ellipsis rules).
    *   **Headers:** Use `#### Some Title` (Markdown H4) only for section headers, and only as the first thing inside a docstring's section.
    *   **HTML:** Do NOT use any HTML tags besides `<br>` and the special docs components defined below.

### Structure of a Docstring

Follow this exact structure and formatting style. You may omit sections if they don't apply, but if included, they MUST be in this order and style:

````python
"""A short 1-2 line long description of the var/func/class does.\n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   `param1` – Short description of the first param.
*   `param2` – Longer description of the second param, which is too long to<br>
    fit within the 99 character limit, so it will be wrapped to the next line.
*   `param3` – Short description of the last param.\n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raises `SomeError` if some condition is met during execution.\n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Attention:** Something important the user should be aware of when using this var/func/class.\n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Example Usages

**Example 1:**
```python
...
```

**Example 2:**
```python
...
```"""
````

### Module Docstrings

The HR, text width, and quote placement rules above do **NOT** apply to module-level docstrings (the docstrings placed at the very top of a module file):

-   **Quotes Placement:** Unlike other docstrings, module docstrings MUST have the starting `"""` on its own line, with the first content line starting on the line below it. The closing `"""` MUST also be placed on its own line directly below the last content line (with no extra blank line before `"""`).
-   **Text Width:** Content in module docstrings has a maximum width of **127 characters** (matching the repo's max linting line-length).
-   **Horizontal Rules:** Use standard Markdown `---` (three characters wide) with an empty line before and after them, following standard Markdown linting rules.

**Example Module Docstring:**

```python
"""
A concise description of what this module provides.

Additional paragraphs or sections separated by markdown horizontal rules.
"""
```

## 2. Special Docs Components

These are HTML comments used to render custom blocks on the generated docs website.

### Attached Code

Mainly used to show the output/result of a code example. In the IDE, this will look like a normal code block, but on the website, it will be styled specifically as an attached output block.

**Format:**

````python
"""…\n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Example Usage

```python
import xulbux as xx
import regex

pattern = xx.regex.func_call("input")
text = "Call print('hello') and input('prompt') and print('world')"
matches = regex.findall(pattern, text)
```

<!-- DOCS: <AttachedCode> -->
Matches:

```python
[
    ("input", "'prompt'")
]
```
<!-- DOCS: </AttachedCode> -->"""
````

**Result on website:**

### Terminal Output

Used to display the output of a terminal-outputting code example. Note that this won't be rendered at all in an IDE's docstring render, but it will render properly with colors on the docs website.

**Format:**

````python
"""…\n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Example Usage

```python
(S.BLACK | S.BG.GREEN)(" OK ").rjust(20, ".").print()
```

<!-- DOCS: <TerminalOutput>
................<span class="black bg-green"> OK </span>
</TerminalOutput> -->"""
````

**Result on website:**
![Terminal Output Example](img/terminal-output.png)

*Note on Terminal Output Colors:* Classes for all default terminal styles/colors are predefined. Custom terminal styles are available in `docs/src/.vitepress/theme/style.css` under `/* Terminal Output Styles */`. If a needed color isn't there, define a new one.

## 3. Comments

### General Rules

1.  **Inline Code:** Always use backticks `` ` `` for variables and other inline-code inside comments. Do NOT use normal quotes for this.
2.  **Comment Length:** Prefer single-line comments. If a comment must span multiple lines, keep it to a maximum of **two lines** (max 2 lines).
3.  **Block Comments:** If a comment is written on its own line to describe upcoming line(s) of code:
    *   For single-line comments, end with a colon `:`.
    *   For multi-line comments (max 2 lines), preceding lines can end normally in a period `.`, and only the last line must end with a colon `:`.
4.  **Inline Comments:** If a comment is written on the same line, behind code, always end it with a period `.`.
5.  **Numbered Comments:** When writing numbered step comments (e.g., step-by-step logic), ALWAYS format numbers with square brackets like `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, etc. (e.g., `# [1] Parse input:`, `# [2] Validate options:`), NEVER with trailing periods like `1.`, `2.`, etc.
6.  **Type Ignore Pragmas:** Follow the strict typing and ignore rules in `AGENTS.md` Section 1.

### Section Separators

Section separators help organize the code and must follow strict width and casing rules.

-   **Goal & Centering:** The primary goal is to always have the text perfectly centered within the `*` characters, with an equal amount of `*` characters on the left and right sides of the text (`# <*s> <TEXT> <*s>`).
-   **Top-Level Separators:** These must be exactly **127 characters** wide (the max linting line-length).
-   **Internal Separators (Inside definitions):** These must be exactly **65 characters** wide (measuring the comment itself from `#`).
-   **Text Formatting:** The text within the separator must be **ALL UPPERCASE**, except for inline-code which should just use normal casing (do not encase it in backticks in the separator). The text must be padded with a single space on each side before the `*` characters.
-   **Padding & Parity:** Pad with `*` characters to reach the exact required character width. Because the separator must be of an exact character width, it may happen that the length of the text does not allow for an even number of total `*` characters to divide equally across both sides. In such a case, the left `*`s part must have exactly **ONE `*` less** than the right `*`s side (`len(left) == len(right) - 1`) to reach the required total character count.

**Example (Top-Level - 127 characters wide, odd total `*` padding → left has one less `*`):**

```python
# ****************************************************** Throbber TESTS *******************************************************
```

**Example (Top-Level - 127 characters wide, even total `*` padding → equal `*` count on both sides):**

```python
# ********************************************************* CONSTANTS *********************************************************
```

**Example (Internal - 65 characters wide, even total `*` padding → equal `*` count on both sides):**

```python
# ******************** CUSTOM COLORS & LINKS ********************
```

**Example (Internal - 65 characters wide, odd total `*` padding → left has one less `*`):**

```python
# ************************* PROPERTIES **************************
```
