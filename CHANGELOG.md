## … `v2.0` Major Release 💎

*   **Quality & Consistency:**
    -   Unified all error messages throughout the whole library to always pass the given value if the error is caused by that value being invalid.
    -   Reformatted all docstrings across the library to be consistent in style and structure and to use proper sentences.
    -   Corrected and refined static type hints across the entire library for strict MyPyC compatibility.
    -   Rewrote existing tests and added comprehensive new tests to achieve 100% test coverage with consistent structure.
*   **Performance Optimizations:**
    -   Improved the performance of `console.log()` by restructuring formatting and output pipelines.
    -   Improved the performance of `string.normalize_spaces()` by using `str.translate()` instead of multiple `str.replace()` calls.
    -   Improved the performance of `data.remove_duplicates()` for lists and tuples:<br>
        Hashable items now deduplicate in $O(n)$ using `dict.fromkeys()`, with an $O(n^2)$ equality-check fallback only for unhashable items (lists, dicts, sets).
*   **Feature Enhancements:**
    -   Added a `@deprecated` decorator to `xulbux.base.decorators` that conditionally imports from `warnings` on Python 3.13+ and `typing_extensions` on older versions.
    -   Added two new public constants `FRAMES_STANDARD` and `FRAMES_WINDMILL` to the `console` module, usable as `frames` presets for the `Throbber` class.
    -   `console.log()` no longer forces the title to be uppercase, allowing customizable capitalization.
    -   Added support for fixed `width` and automatic content wrapping in `console.box()`, wrapping text lines that exceed the box width while preserving ANSI styles and `{hr}` rules.
    -   Added support for content alignment in `console.box()` via `align: Literal["left", "center", "right"] = "left"`.
    -   Added `KEYS` constants in `xulbux.base.consts` exposing standardized sequences and sets for directional arrows, navigation, actions, and function keys.
    -   Added `console.raw_mode()` context manager for terminal unbuffered raw mode with enhanced key protocols.
    -   Added `console.read_key()` for reading single key presses and ANSI escape sequences in the terminal with cross-platform support.
    -   Implemented a custom stub generator for improved `.pyi` type stub generation during the build process.
    -   Added color space interpolation and multi-stop scale generators in `color`: `interpolate_color()` and `create_gradient()`, supporting RGB, HSL (shortest and long arc), Linear RGB, and Oklab color spaces.
    -   Added `allow_strings: bool = True` parameter to `is_valid_rgba()` and `is_valid_hsla()`, supporting overloaded type guards to validate either `Rgba | str` or strictly non-string `Rgba`/`Hsla` types.
    -   Added `Seq[T]`, `is_seq()`, and `is_dict()` type definitions and type guard helpers to `xulbux.base.types`.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   **Python Version Support:**
    *   Dropped support for Python 3.10 and 3.11. **The library now requires Python 3.12 or higher.**
*   **Architectural & Namespace Refactor:**
    *   Renamed the `file_sys` module to `fs` for more concise and standard file system operations.
    *   Removed default module classes (`Console`, `System`, `FileSys`, `Data`, `String`, `Code`, `EnvPath`, `Json`, `Regex`, `File`) that acted as namespaces; all methods are now accessible directly as module-level functions (e.g., `xulbux.console.log`).
    *   Properties like `console.w` and `system.is_elevated` have been converted into standard getter functions like `get_width()` and `is_elevated()` to circumvent a MyPyC segmentation fault.
    *   Consolidated module structure:
        -   Moved `code` functions into `string` (`add_indent()`, `get_tab_spaces()`, `change_tab_spaces()`, `extract_func_calls()`, `is_js()`) and deleted the `code` module.
        -   Moved `env_path` functions into `system` (`get_env_path()`, `has_env_path()`, `add_env_path()`, `remove_env_path()`) and deleted the `env_path` module.
        -   Moved `file` functions into `fs` (`create_file()`, `rename_file_ext()`) and deleted the `file` module.
        -   Moved `json` functions into `fs` (`read_json()`, `create_json()`, `update_json()`) and deleted the `json` module.
*   **New Operator-Based Styling Engine (`ansi` module):**
    *   Removed the `format_codes` module and bracket syntax in favor of the new operator-based styling engine in the `ansi` module (including the removal of legacy format-code constants from `xulbux.base.consts`):
        -   The new `S` class exposes every ANSI style/color attribute and uses `|` to combine styles and `()` to apply them to text, e.g., `(S.BOLD | S.RED)("hi")` and `S.hex("#A8F")("hi")`.
        -   The `S(*segments, sep="")` class also directly builds the ANSI string on construction and exposes `.ansi`, `.raw`, `.code_positions`, `.raw_code_positions`, `.print()` and `.input()`.
        -   A companion `Term` class provides commonly used cursor- and screen-control sequences (`Term.HIDE_CURSOR`, `Term.up(n)`, `Term.move(row, col)`, `Term.title(text)`, …).
    *   Migrated the entire `console` module to the new styling API:
        -   All prompts, messages, and content now accept `Renderable` and `TextRenderable` types.
        -   All color parameters now accept `ColorStyle` types instead of strings, `rgba`, or `hexa` objects.
    *   `data.render()` now returns an `S` object, and its `syntax_highlighting` dictionary takes `S` styles.
    *   Removed the `xulbux-lib fc` CLI command, since the new styling API doesn't support the old format string syntax.
*   **Data & Type Modernization:**
    -   Replaced `get_args` and `_ConsoleArgsParseHelper` with fully typed `ArgumentParser` and `ParsedArgData` classes.
    -   `data.render(as_json=True)` now natively converts special Python objects into valid JSON strings without proprietary representations.
    -   Replaced the separator-based path ID format (e.g., `"1>011"`) in `data.get_path_id()` with a compact, separator-free uppercase hexadecimal encoding (e.g., `"1011"`, `"10C"`).
    -   Replaced runtime type tuples like `DataObjTT` with type guard functions like `is_data_obj()`.
    -   Changed `IndexIterable` to `SeqOrSet[T]` and added `is_seq_or_set()`.
    -   Removed raw `str` and `list[float]` from `Rgba` and `Hsla` type aliases, reserving them strictly for structured color representations (objects, tuples, lists of integers, and typed dicts).
    -   Updated `RgbaDict`, `HslaDict`, and `HexaDict` schemas to disallow explicit `None` for the optional `alpha` key (`alpha: NotRequired[float]` and `NotRequired[str]`).
    -   `rgba.blend()` and `hsla.blend()` no longer accept color strings directly (raising `TypeError`); color strings must be converted beforehand via `to_rgba()` or `to_hsla()`.
    -   `is_valid_rgba()` and `is_valid_hsla()` now reject 4-element sequences with `None` as the fourth element and dictionaries with `alpha: None`.
*   **Renamed Functions & Methods:**
    *   **`color`:**
        -   `text_color_for_on_bg()` (and `fg_for_on_bg()`) → `get_text_fg()`.
        -   `luminance()` → `get_luminance()`.
        -   `str_to_rgba()` and `str_to_hsla()` → `extract_rgba()` and `extract_hsla()`.
        -   `.values()`, `.dict()`, `.to_rgba()`, `.to_hsla()`, `.to_hexa()` → `.as_tuple()`, `.as_dict()`, `.as_rgba()`, `.as_hsla()`, `.as_hexa()`.
    *   **`console`:**
        -   `cls()` → `clear()` (with fixed cross-platform terminal clearing on Windows and Unix).
        -   `log_box_filled()` and `log_box_bordered()` → unified into `box()`.
        -   `supports_color()` → `has_color_support()`.
        -   `ProgressBar`: `bar_format`, `limited_bar_format`, `set_bar_format()` → `format`, `limited_format`, `set_format()`.
        -   `Throbber`: `throbber_format` → `format`.
    *   **`data` & `string`:**
        -   `data.chars_count()` → `data.count_chars()`.
        -   `string.single_char_repeats()` → `string.count_char_repeats()`.
        -   `string.split_count()` → `string.chunk()`.
        -   `string.change_tab_size()` → `string.change_tab_spaces()`.
    *   **Parameters & Constants:**
        -   Single-letter color channel parameters `r`, `g`, `b`, `h`, `s`, `l`, `a` → `red`, `green`, `blue`, `hue`, `sat`, `light`, `alpha`.
        -   `string.decompose()`: parameter `case_string` → `string`.
        -   `data.is_equal()`: parameters `data1, data2` → `data_a, data_b`.
        -   `console.log_box_bordered()`: parameter `border_chars` now takes a string of 11 characters instead of a tuple of 11 characters.
        -   `console.box()`: parameter `w_full` → `width: int | Literal["full"] | None = None`.
        -   `console.pause_exit()` and log presets (`debug()`, `info()`, `done()`, `warn()`, `fail()`): Replaced `exit: bool` and `exit_code: int` with `exit_code: int | None = None` (`None` to not exit, or an integer exit code).
        -   `console.exit()`: Removed redundant `exit` boolean toggle parameter in favor of always exiting with `exit_code: int`, typed as `NoReturn`.
*   **Removals:**
    -   Removed `w_padding` parameter from `console.box()` in favor of automatic contextual padding.
    -   Removed `data.print()` (use `data.render(…).print()`).
    -   Removed `serialize_bytes()` and `deserialize_bytes()` from `data` (byte serialization is now handled natively).
    -   Removed `console.get_user()` in favor of `system.get_username()`.
    -   Removed `reset_ansi` parameter almost everywhere (append `S.RESET` directly if needed).
    -   Removed `format_linebreaks` parameter from `console.log()`.
    -   Removed `FormattableString`, `AnyRgba`, `AnyHsla`, and `AnyHexa` type aliases from `xulbux.base.types`.
    -   Removed `COLOR` class presets and `ANSI` class from `xulbux.base.consts`.


<span id="v1-9-7" />

## 26.04.2026 `v1.9.7`

*   Restructured CLI commands under a single `xulbux-lib` entry point:
    -   `xulbux-lib` – Shows library info.
    -   `xulbux-lib fc` (new) – Parses and renders a string's format codes as ANSI console output.
*   Added a `.get()` method to `ParsedArgData` for safe index access on parsed argument values.
*   Added missing `__init__.py` files to the `base` and `cli` subpackages.
*   Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` caused by `mypyc` compiling `__init__.py` files, which broke subpackage imports.
*   Simplified CI workflows to use `pip`'s build isolation instead of manually specifying build dependencies.
*   Fixed a small bug in `ProgressBar`, where it would only overwrite and not actually clear the previous line.
*   Added a new constant `ANSI.COLOR_VARIANTS_MAP`, which contains all possible color variants that can be used in formatting.
*   Made it possible to also pass console default colors to `title_bg_color` in `Console.log()`, instead of only custom RGBA or hex colors.
*   Added a new format key `link:…` to `FormatCodes`, which allows you to create hyperlinks in the console output with the syntax `[link:URL](display text)`.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   The `ANSI.COLOR_MAP` constant is now a set for better lookup performance, as the color order doesn't matter there.
*   All `Console` methods that allow console default colors as input for their color parameters now actually validate the given color, raising an error if it's not valid.
*   The default for `box_bg_color` in `Console.log_box_filled()` is now the console foreground color (`None`) instead of `br:green`.


<span id="v1-9-6" />

## 13.04.2026 `v1.9.6`

*   The compiled version of the library now includes the type stub files (`.pyi`), so type checkers can thoroughly check types.
*   Made all type hints in the whole library way more strict and accurate.
*   Removed leftover unnecessary runtime type checks in several functions throughout the whole library.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   All signatures that should use positional-only and keyword-only parameters now actually enforce that by using the `/` and `*` syntax.
*   Renamed the `Spinner` class from the `console` module to `Throbber`, since that name is closer to what it's actually used for.
*   Changed the name of the TypeAlias `DataStructure` to `DataObj` because that name is shorter and more general.
*   Changed both names `DataStructureTypes` and `IndexIterableTypes` to `DataObjTT` and `IndexIterableTT` respectively (`TT` = type tuple).
*   Made the return value of `String.single_char_repeats()` always be *`int`* and not `int | bool`.


<span id="v1-9-5" />

## 25.01.2026 `v1.9.5`

*   Added a new class property `Console.encoding`, which returns the encoding used by the console (e.g., `utf-8`, `cp1252`, …).
*   Added multiple new class properties to the `System` class:
    -   `is_linux` – Whether the current OS is Linux or not.
    -   `is_mac` – Whether the current OS is macOS or not.
    -   `is_unix` – Whether the current OS is a Unix-like OS (Linux, macOS, BSD, …) or not.
    -   `hostname` – The network hostname of the current machine.
    -   `username` – The current user's username.
    -   `os_name` – The name of the operating system (e.g., `Windows`, `Linux`, …).
    -   `os_version` – The version of the operating system.
    -   `architecture` – The CPU architecture (e.g., `x86_64`, `ARM`, …).
    -   `cpu_count` – The number of CPU cores available.
    -   `python_version` – The Python version string (e.g., `3.10.4`).
*   Created two new type aliases:
    -   `ArgParseConfig` – Matches the command-line-parsing configuration of a single argument.
    -   `ArgParseConfigs` – Matches the command-line-parsing configurations of multiple arguments, packed in a dictionary.
*   Added a new attribute `flag` to the `ArgData` TypedDict and the `ArgResult` class, which contains the specific flag that was found or `None` for positional args.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Rewrote `Console.get_args()` for different parsing functionality:
    -   Flagged values are now also saved to lists, so only the `values` attribute is used for all argument types.
    -   The results of parsed command-line arguments are also no longer differentiated between regular flagged arguments and positional `"before"`/`"after"` arguments.
    -   The parameter `allow_spaces` was removed, and therefore a new parameter `flag_value_sep` was added, which specifies the character(s) used to separate flags from their values.<br>
        This means flags can now **only** receive values when the separator is present (e.g., `--flag=value` or `--flag = value`).
*   Combined the custom TypedDict classes `ArgResultRegular` and `ArgResultPositional` into a single TypedDict class `ArgData`, which is now used for all parsed command-line arguments.
*   Renamed the classes `Args` and `ArgResult` to `ParsedArgs` and `ParsedArgData` to better describe their purpose.
*   Renamed the attribute `is_positional` to `is_pos` everywhere so its name isn't that long.


<span id="v1-9-4" />

## 06.01.2026 `v1.9.4`

*   Added a new base module `base.decorators` which contains custom decorators used throughout the library.
*   Made `mypy_extensions` an optional dependency by wrapping all uses of `mypy_extensions.mypyc_attr` in a custom decorator that acts as a no-op if `mypy_extensions` is not installed.
*   The methods from the `env_path` module that modify the PATH environment variable no longer sort all paths alphabetically but keep the original order to not mess with the user's intended PATH order.
*   Added a new TypeAlias `PathsList` to the `base.types` module, which matches a list of paths as strings or `pathlib.Path` objects.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Renamed the module `path` to `fs` and its main class `Path` to `FileSys`, so you can better use it alongside the built-in `pathlib.Path` class without always needing to import one of them under an alias.
*   Renamed most `FileSys` methods to better describe their functionality:
    -   `Path.extend()` is now `FileSys.extend_path()`.
    -   `Path.extend_or_make()` is now `FileSys.extend_or_make_path()`.
*   Renamed the parameter `use_closest_match` in `FileSys.extend_path()` and `FileSys.extend_or_make_path()` to `fuzzy_match`, since that name is more commonly used for that functionality.
*   Updated all library methods that work with paths to accept `pathlib.Path` objects in addition to strings as path inputs.
*   Also, all library methods that return paths now return `pathlib.Path` objects instead of strings.


<span id="v1-9-3" />

## 01.01.2026 `v1.9.3` Big Update 🚀

**𝓗𝓪𝓹𝓹𝔂 𝟚𝟘𝟚𝟞 🎉**

*   Added a new method `Color.str_to_hsla()` to parse HSLA colors from strings.
*   Changed the default syntax highlighting for `Data.to_str()` and therefore also `Data.print()` to use console default colors.
*   Added the missing but needed dunder methods to the `Args` and `ArgResult` classes and the `rgba`, `hsla` and `hexa` color objects for better usability and type checking.
*   Added three new methods to `Args`:
    -   `get()` – Returns the argument result for a given alias or a default value if not found.
    -   `existing()` – Yields only the existing arguments as tuples of `(alias, ArgResult)`.
    -   `missing()` – Yields only the missing arguments as tuples of `(alias, ArgResult)`.
*   Added a new attribute `is_positional` to `ArgResult`, which indicates whether the argument is a positional argument or not.
*   The `ArgResult` class now also has a `dict()` method, which returns the argument result as a dictionary.
*   Added new properties `is_tty` and `supports_color` to the `Console` class, `home` to the `Path` class, and `is_win` to the `System` class.
*   Added the option to add format specifiers to the `{current}`, `{total}` and `{percentage}` placeholders in the `bar_format` and `limited_bar_format` of `ProgressBar`.
*   Finally fixed the `C901 'Console.get_args' is too complex (39)` linting error by refactoring the method into its helper class.
*   Changed the string- and repr-representations of the `rgba` and `hsla` color objects and newly implemented it for the `Args` and `ArgResult` classes.
*   Made internal, global constants, whose values never change, into `Final` constants for better type checking.
*   The names of all internal classes and methods are all no longer prefixed with a double underscore (`__`), but a single underscore (`_`) instead.
*   Changed all methods defined as `@staticmethod` to `@classmethod` where applicable to improve inheritance capabilities.
*   Adjusted the whole library's type hints to be way more strict and accurate, using `mypy` as a static type checker.
*   Changed the class-property definitions to be defined via `metaclass` and use `@property` decorators to make them compatible with `mypyc`.
*   Unnest all the nested methods in the whole library for compatibility with `mypyc`.
*   The library is now compiled using `mypyc` when installing, which makes it run significantly faster. Benchmarking results:
    -   Simple methods like data and color operations had a speed improvement of around 50%.
    -   Complex methods like console logging had a speed improvement of up to 230%!

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Renamed `Data.to_str()` to `Data.render()`, since that describes its functionality better (especially with the syntax highlighting option).
*   Renamed the constant `ANSI.ESCAPED_CHAR` to `ANSI.CHAR_ESCAPED` for better consistency with the other constant names.
*   Removed the general `Pattern` and `Match` type aliases from the `base.types` module (they are pointless since you should always use a specific type and not “type1 OR typeB”).
*   Removed the `_` prefix from the parameter `_syntax_highlighting` in `Data.render()`, since it's no longer just for internal use.


<span id="v1-9-2" />

## 16.12.2025 `v1.9.2`

*   Added a new class `LazyRegex` to the `regex` module, which is used to define regex patterns that are only compiled when they are used for the first time.
*   Removed unnecessary character escaping in the precompiled regex patterns in the `console` module.
*   Removed all the runtime type checks that can also be checked using static type-checking tools, since you're supposed to use type checkers in modern Python anyway, and to improve performance.
*   Renamed the internal class method `FormatCodes.__config_console()` to `FormatCodes._config_console()` to make it callable but still indicate that it's internal.
*   Fixed a small bug where `Console.log_box_…()` would crash when calling it without providing any `*values` (content for inside the box).

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   The arguments when calling `Console.get_args()` are no longer specified in a single dictionary, but now each argument is passed as a separate keyword argument.<br>
    You can still use a dictionary just fine by simply unpacking it with `**`, like this:

    ```python
    Console.get_args(**{"arg": {"-a", "--arg"}})
    ```

*   Replaced the internal `_COMPILED` regex pattern dictionaries with `LazyRegex` objects so it won't compile all regex patterns on library import, but only when they are used for the first time, which improves the library's import time.
*   Renamed the internal `_COMPILED` regex pattern dictionaries to `_PATTERNS` for better clarity.
*   Removed the import of the `ProgressBar` class from the `__init__.py` file since it's not an important main class that should be imported directly.
*   Renamed the constant `CLR` to `CLI_COLORS` and the constant `HELP` to `CLI_HELP` in the `cli.help` module.
*   Changed the default value of the `strip_spaces` parameter in `Regex.brackets()` from `True` to `False`, since this is more intuitive behavior.


<span id="v1-9-1" />

## 26.11.2025 `v1.9.1`

*   Unified the module and class docstring styles throughout the whole library.
*   Moved the protocol `ProgressUpdater` from the `console` module to the `types` module.
*   Added throttling to the `ProgressBar` update methods to impact the actual process' performance as little as possible.
*   Added a new class `Spinner` to the `console` module, which is used to display a spinner animation in the console during an ongoing process.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Made the value input into the parameters `bar_format` and `limited_bar_format` of `ProgressBar` be a list/tuple of strings instead of a single string so the user can define multiple formats for different console widths.
*   Added a new parameter `sep: str = " "` to the `ProgressBar` class, which is used to join multiple bar-format strings.
*   Renamed the class property `Console.wh` to `Console.size`, since it describes the property better.
*   Renamed the class property `Console.usr` to `Console.user`, since it describes the property better.
*   Added missing type checking to methods in the `path` module.

<span id="v1-9-0" />

## 21.11.2025 `v1.9.0` Big Update 🚀

*   Standardized the docstrings for all public methods in the whole library to use the same style and structure.
*   Replaced left over single quotes with double quotes for consistency.
*   Fixed a bug inside `Data.remove_empty_items()`, where types apart from strings were passed to `String.is_empty()`, which caused an exception.
*   Refactored/reformatted the code of the whole library to introduce clearer code structure with more room to breathe.
*   Made the really complex regex patterns in the `Regex` class all multiline for better readability.
*   Added a new internal method `Regex._clean()`, which is used to clean up the regex patterns defined as multiline strings.
*   Moved custom exception classes to their file `base/exceptions.py` so the user can easily import them all from the same place.
*   Moved custom types to their file `base/types.py` so the user can easily import them all from the same place.
*   Removed unnecessary duplicate code in several methods throughout the library.
*   Introduced some minor performance improvements in a few methods that might be called very frequently in a short time span.
*   Added a small description to the docstrings of all modules and their main classes.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   The `find_args` parameter from the method `Console.get_args()` now only accepts sets for the flags instead of lists/tuples since the order of flags doesn't matter and sets have better performance for lookups.
*   Added missing type checking to all public methods in the whole library, so now they will all throw errors if the parameters aren't of the expected type.
*   Removed the second definitions of constants in with lowercase names in the `ANSI` class inside the `consts` module, so now you can only access them with their uppercase names (e.g., `ANSI.CHAR` instead of `ANSI.char`).


<span id="v1-8-5" />

## 14.11.2025 `v1.8.5`

*   Made the help command `xulbux-help` use console default colors so it fits the user's console theme.
*   Changed the default `box_bg_color` in `Console.log_box_filled()` from `green` to `br:green`.
*   Fixed a bug in all methods of `FormatCodes`, where as soon as you used more than a single modifier format code (e.g., `[ll]` or `[++]`), it was treated as invalid and ignored.
*   Added a new method `FormatCodes.escape()` which will escape all valid formatting codes in a string.
*   Again refactored the whole `CHANGELOG.md` to use actual sentences and added a `BREAKING CHANGES` section to more clearly highlight breaking changes.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Removed the `*c` and `*color` formatting codes, since the user should just use the code `default` to achieve the same instead.
*   Renamed the method `FormatCodes.remove_formatting()` to `FormatCodes.remove()`.


<span id="v1-8-4" />

## 11.11.2025 `v1.8.4`

**𝓢𝓲𝓷𝓰𝓵𝓮𝓼 𝓓𝓪𝔂 🥇😉**

*   Adjusted `Regex.hsla_str()` to not include optional degree (`°`) and percent (`%`) symbols in the captured groups.
*   Fixed that `Regex.hexa_str()` couldn't match hex colors anywhere inside a string, but only if the whole string was just the hex color.
*   Added `_ArgResultRegular` and `_ArgResultPositional` TypedDict classes for better type hints in `Args.dict()` and `Args.items()` methods.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   The method `Console.get_args()` no longer tries to convert found arg values to their respective types since that caused too many unwanted wrong type conversions.
*   `ArgResult` now has separate properties for different argument types to improve type safety and eliminate the need for type casting when accessing argument values:
    -   `value: Optional[str]` – For regular flagged arguments.
    -   `values: list[str]` – For positional `"before"`/`"after"` arguments.


<span id="v1-8-3" />

## 08.10.2025 `v1.8.3`

*   Adjusted the look of the prompts and inputs of the `System.check_libs()` method.
*   Added a new parameter to `System.check_libs()`:<br>
    `missing_libs_msgs: tuple[str, str] = (…)` – Two messages:<br>
    The first one is displayed when missing libraries are found.<br>
    The second one is the confirmation message before installing missing libraries.
*   Adjusted error messages throughout the whole library to all be structured about the same.
*   Fixed a small bug in `FormatCodes.__config_console()`, where it would cause an exception because it tried to configure Windows-specific console settings on non-Windows systems.
*   The `Console.get_args()` method will now treat everything as values (even if it starts with `-` or `--`) unless it's specified in the `find_args` parameter.
*   Added two new parameters to all the `Console.log()` presets:<br>
    -   `exit_code: int = 0` – The exit code to use if `exit` is true.
    -   `reset_ansi: bool = True` – Whether to reset all ANSI formatting after pausing/exiting or not.
*   Made the type hints and value checks for `Console.get_args()` more strict.
*   You can now insert horizontal rules inside a `Console.log_box_bordered()` by putting `{hr}` in the text.
*   Made it possible to also update the title within a `ProgressBar.progress_context()` using the returned callable with the new kwarg `label`.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Reordered the parameters of `Console.pause_exit()` to be more logical.


<span id="v1-8-2" />

## 11.09.2025 `v1.8.2`

*   The client command `xulbux-help` now tells you that there's a newer version of the library available if you're not using the latest version.
*   Added two new parameters to `Console.input()`:
    -   `default_val: Optional[T] = None` – The default value to return if the input is empty.
    -   `output_type: type[T] = str` – The type (class) to convert the input to before returning it.
*   Added a new class `ProgressBar` to the `console` module.
*   Made a small performance improvement in `FormatCodes.to_ansi()`.
*   Added missing docstrings to several public class variables.
*   Added the missing tests for methods in the `console` module.
*   Added a test for the last two modules that didn't have tests until now: `regex` and `system`.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Spaces between a format code and the auto-reset brackets are no longer allowed, so `[red]␣(text)` will not be automatically reset and output as `␣(text)`.


<span id="v1-8-1" />

## 20.08.2025 `v1.8.1`

*   **<u>HOTFIX:</u> Fixed a critical bug that caused the package to not install properly and make the whole library not work.**
*   Fixed several small bugs regarding the tabs and text wrapping inside `Console.log()`.
*   Added two new parameters to `Console.log()`:
    -   `title_px: int = 1` – The horizontal padding (in chars) to the title (if `title_bg_color` is set).
    -   `title_mx: int = 2` – The horizontal margin (in chars) to the title.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Renamed the parameter `_console_tabsize` from the method `Console.log()` to `tab_size`, and it will now just set the size for the log directly instead of specifying what the console's tab size is.


<span id="v1-8-0" />

## 28.08.2025 `v1.8.0` **⚠️ This release is broken!**

*   New options for the parameter `find_args` from the method `Console.get_args()`:<br>
    Previously, you could only input a dictionary with items like `"alias_name": ["-f", "--flag"]` that specify an arg's alias and the flags that correspond to it.<br>
    New, instead of flags, you can also once use the literal `"before"` and once `"after"`, which corresponds to all non-flagged values before or after all flagged values.
*   Changed the default `default_color` for all `Console` class input methods to `None`.
*   Now `prompt` from `Console.pause_exit()` also supports custom formatting codes and the method new pauses per default (without exiting).

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   The method `Console.restricted_input()` now returns an empty string instead of `None` if the user didn't input anything.
*   Completely rewrote `Console.restricted_input()`, so now it's actually usable, and renamed it to just `Console.input()`.
*   Removed method `Console.pwd_input()`, since you can now simply use `Console.input(mask_char="*")` instead, which does the same thing.
*   Removed the CLI command `xx-help`, since it was redundant because there's already the CLI command `xulbux-help`.
*   Renamed the previously internal module `_consts_` to `consts` and made it accessible via `from xulbux.base.consts import …`, since you should be able to use library constants without them being «internal».
*   Removed the `xx_` from all the library modules since it's redundant, and without it, the imports look more professional and cleaner.
*   The constants from inside the `consts` module are now all uppercase (except the class methods) to make clear that they're constants.
*   Removed the wildcard imports from the `__init__.py` file, so now you can only access the main classes directly with `from xulbux import …` and for the rest you have to import the specific module first.


<span id="v1-7-3" />

## 29.07.2025 `v1.7.3`

*   Added a new parameter to the methods `Console.log_box_filled()` and `Console.log_box_bordered()`:<br>
    `indent: int = 0` – The indentation of the box (in chars).
*   Fixed a bug in `Console.log_box_filled()` where the box background color would sometimes not stop at the box's edge but would continue to the end of the console line.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Removed the parameter `title_bg_color` from the `Console.log()` preset methods since that is part of the preset and doesn't need to be changed by the user.


<span id="v1-7-2" />

## 17.06.2025 `v1.7.2`

*   The `Console.w`, `Console.h` and `Console.wh` class properties now return a default size if there is no console, instead of throwing an error.
*   It wasn't actually possible to use default console colors (e.g., `"red"`, `"green"`, …) for the color parameters in `Console.log()` so that option was completely removed again.
*   Upgraded the speed of `FormatCodes.to_ansi()` by adding the internal ability to skip the `default_color` validation.
*   Fixed type hints for the whole library.
*   Fixed a small bug in `Console.pause_exit()`, where the key pressed to unpause wasn't suppressed, so it was written into the next console input after unpausing.


<span id="v1-7-1" />

## 11.06.2025 `v1.7.1`

*   Resolved an issue with the `Color.is_valid_…()` and `Color.is_valid()` methods, where you were unable to input any color without a type mismatch.
*   Added a new method `Console.log_box_bordered()`, which does the same as `Console.log_box_filled()`, but with a border instead of a background color.
*   The module `xx_format_codes` now treats the `[*]` to-default-color-reset as a normal full reset when no `default_color` is set instead of just counting it as an invalid format code.
*   Fixed a bug where entering a color as a hex integer in the color parameters of the methods `Console.log()`, `Console.log_box_filled()` and `Console.log_box_bordered()` would not work, because it was not properly converted to a format code.
*   You can now use default console colors (e.g., `"red"`, `"green"`, …) for the color parameters in `Console.log()`.
*   The methods `Console.log_box_filled()` and `Console.log_box_bordered()` no longer right-strip spaces, so you can make multiple log boxes the same width by adding spaces to the end of the text.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Renamed the method `Console.log_box()` to `Console.log_box_filled()`.


<span id="v1-7-0" />

## 28.05.2025 `v1.7.0`

*   Fixed a small bug in `Console.log()` where empty line breaks were removed.
*   Corrected and added missing type hints for the whole library.
*   Fixed possibly unbound variables for the whole library.
*   Updated the client command `xulbux-help`.


<span id="v1-6-9" />

## 30.04.2025 `v1.6.9`

*   Added a new parameter to the methods `FormatCodes.remove_ansi()` and `FormatCodes.remove_formatting()`:<br>
    `_ignore_linebreaks: bool = False` – Whether to include line breaks in the removal positions or not.
*   Added a new parameter to method `Color.luminance()` and to the `.grayscale()` method of all color types:
    `method: str = "wcag2"` – The luminance calculation method to use.
*   Added a new parameter to the method `File.rename_extension()`:
    `full_extension: bool = False` – Whether to treat everything behind the first `.` as the extension or everything behind the last `.`.
*   Fixed a small bug in `Console.log_box()` where the leading spaces were removed from the box content.
*   You can now assign default values to args in `Console.get_args()`.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Changed the parameters in `Json.create()`:
    -   `new_file: str = "config"` is now the first parameter and `content: dict` the second one.
    -   `new_file: str = "config"` is now called `json_file: str` with no default value.
*   The methods `Json.update()` and `Data.set_value_by_path_id()` now take a dictionary as the `update_values` parameter instead of a list of strings.
*   Renamed parameter `correct_path` in `Path.extend()` and parameter `correct_paths` in `File.extend_or_make_path()` to `use_closest_match`, since this name describes its functionality better.
*   Moved the method `extend_or_make_path()` from the `xx_file` module to the `xx_path` module and renamed it to `extend_or_make()`.


<span id="v1-6-8" />

## 18.03.2025 `v1.6.8`

*   Made it possible to escape formatting codes by putting a slash (`/` or `\\`) at the beginning inside the brackets (e.g., `[/red]`).
*   New methods for `Args` (the returned object from `Console.get_args()`):
    -   The `len()` function can now be used on `Args` (the returned object from `Console.get_args()`).
    -   The `Args` object now also has the dictionary-like methods `.keys()`, `.values()` and `.items()`.
    -   You can also get the args as a dict with the `.dict()` method.
    -   You can now use the `in` operator on `Args`.
*   New methods for `ArgResult` (a single arg-object from inside `Args`):
    -   You can now use the `bool()` function on `ArgResult` to directly see if the arg exists.
*   The methods `FormatCodes.remove_ansi()` and `FormatCodes.remove_formatting()` now have a second parameter `get_removals: bool = False`:<br>
    If this parameter is true, in addition to the cleaned string, a list of tuples will be returned, where a tuple contains the position of the removed formatting/ANSI code and the removed code.
*   Fixed a bug in the line wrapping in all logging methods from the `xx_console` module.
*   Added a new parameter to the method `Console.get_args()`:<br>
    `allow_spaces: bool = False` – Whether to take spaces as separators of arg values or as part of an arg value.


<span id="v1-6-7" />

## 26.02.2025 `v1.6.7`

*   Made the static method `System.is_elevated()` into a class property, which now can be accessed as `System.is_elevated`.
*   The method `File.create()` now throws a custom `SameContentFileExistsError` exception if a file with the same name and content already exists.
*   Added a bunch more docstrings to class properties and library constants.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Restructured the object returned from `Console.get_args()`:<br>
    Before, you accessed an arg's result with `args["<arg_alias>"]["value"]` and `args["<arg_alias>"]["exists"]`.<br>
    Now, you can directly access the result with `args.<arg_alias>.value` and `args.<arg_alias>.exists`.
*   Made the method `Path.get(cwd=True)` or `Path.get(base_dir=True)` into two class properties, which now can be accessed as `Path.cwd` and `Path.script_dir`.


<span id="v1-6-6" />

## 17.02.2025 `v1.6.6`

*   Added a new method `Console.multiline_input()`.
*   Added two new parameters to the method `Console.log_box()`:<br>
    -   `w_padding: int = 2` – The horizontal padding (in chars) to the box content.<br>
    -   `w_full: bool = False` – Whether to make the box be the full console width or not.
*   Fixed a small bug in `Data.print()` where two parameters passed to `Data.to_str()` were swapped, which caused an error.
*   The method `Data.print()` now per default syntax highlights the console output:<br>
    The syntax highlighting colors and styles can now be customized via the new parameter `syntax_highlighting: dict[str, str] = {…}`.
*   Added two new methods, `Data.serialize_bytes()` and `Data.deserialize_bytes()`.
*   Made the method `String.to_type()` be able to also interpret and convert large, complex structures.
*   Added the new parameter `strip_spaces: bool = True` to the method `Regex.brackets()` which makes it possible to not ignore spaces around the content inside the brackets.
*   Adjusted the `Console.log_box()` method so the box background can't be reset to nothing anymore.
*   Added a new parameter to `Console.log()` (and therefore also to every `Console.log()` preset):<br>
    `format_linebreaks: bool = True` – When true, indents the text after every line break to the level of the previous text.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Restructured the `_consts_` library constants to use `@dataclass` classes (and simpler structured classes) as much as possible.
*   Renamed the `DEFAULT` class from the `_consts_` to `COLOR`, whose colors are now directly accessible as variables (e.g., `COLOR.red`) and not through dictionary keys.
*   Changed the methods `Console.w()`, `Console.h()`, `Console.wh()` and `Console.user()` to modern class properties instead:<br>
    -   `Console.w` – Current console columns (in text characters).<br>
    -   `Console.h` – Current console lines.<br>
    -   `Console.wh` – A tuple with the console size as (columns, lines).<br>
    -   `Console.usr` – The current username.


<span id="v1-6-5" />

## 29.01.2025 `v1.6.5`

*   Now the method `FormatCodes.to_ansi()` automatically converts the parameter `string` to a *`str`* if it isn't one already.
*   Added a new method `FormatCodes.remove_codes()`.
*   Added a new method `FormatCodes.remove_ansi()`.
*   Added a new method `Console.log_box()`.
*   Changed the default values of two parameters in the `Console.log()` method and every log preset:<br>
    -   `start: str = "\n"` changed to `start: str = ""`<br>
    -   `end: str = "\n\n"` changed to `end: str = "\n"`
*   Added the parameters `start: str = ""`, `end: str = "\n"` and `default_color: rgba | hexa = DEFAULT.color["cyan"]` to `Console.restricted_input()` and `Console.pwd_input()`.


<span id="v1-6-4" />

## 22.01.2025 `v1.6.4`

*   **<u>HOTFIX:</u> Fixed a heavy bug, where the library could not be imported after the last update, because of a bug in `xx_format_codes`.**


<span id="v1-6-3" />

## 22.01.2025 `v1.6.3` **⚠️ This release is broken!**

*   Fixed a small bug in `xx_format_codes`:<br>
    Inside print strings, if there was a `'` or `"` inside an auto-reset formatting (e.g., `[u](there's a quote)`), that caused it to not be recognized as valid and therefore not be automatically reset.<br>
    Now this is fixed, and auto-reset formatting works as expected.
*   Added a new parameter `ignore_in_strings: bool = True` to `Regex.brackets()`:<br>
    If this parameter is true and a bracket is inside a string (e.g., `'…'` or `"…"`), it will not be counted as the matching closing bracket.
*   Removed `lru_cache` from the `xx_format_codes` module's internal methods since it was unnecessary.
*   Adjusted `FormatCodes.__config_console()` so it can only be called once per process.


<span id="v1-6-2" />

## 20.01.2025 `v1.6.2`

*   Added a new method `elevate()` to `xx_system`, which is used to request elevated privileges.
*   Fixed a bug in `rgba()`, `hsla()` and `hexa()`:<br>
    Previously, when initializing a color with the alpha channel set to `0.0` (100% transparent), it was saved correctly, but when converted to a different color type or when returned, the alpha channel got ignored, just like if it was `None` or `1.0` (opaque).<br>
    Now when initializing a color with the alpha channel set to `0.0`, this doesn't happen, and when converted or returned, the alpha channel is still `0.0`.
*   Huge speed and efficiency improvements in `xx_color`, due to the newly added option to initialize a color without validation, which saves time when initializing colors when we know that the values are valid.
*   Added a new parameter `reset_ansi: bool = False` to `FormatCodes.input()`:<br>
    If this parameter is true, all formatting will be reset after the user confirms the input and the program continues.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Moved the method `is_admin()` from `xx_console` to `xx_system`.
*   Method `hex_int_to_rgba()` from `xx_color` now returns an `rgba()` object instead of the separate values `r`, `g`, `b` and `a`.


<span id="v1-6-1" />

## 15.01.2025 `v1.6.1`

*   Changed the parameters in `File.make_path()`:<br>
    Previously there were the parameters `filename: str` and `filetype: str = ""` where `filename` didn't have to have the file extension included, as long as the `filetype` was set.<br>
    Now these parameters have become one parameter `file: str` which is the file with the file extension.
*   Removed all line breaks and other Markdown formatting from docstrings, since not all IDEs support them.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Changed the order of the parameters in `File.create()`:<br>
    Until now the parameter `content: str = ""` was the first parameter and `file: str = ""`.<br>
    Now the parameter `file: str = ""` is the first parameter and `content: str = ""` is the second.
*   Renamed `File.make_path()` to a more descriptive name `File.extend_or_make_path()` and adjusted the usages of `File.create()` and `File.make_path()` inside `xx_json` accordingly.


<span id="v1-6-0" />

## 07.01.2025 `v1.6.0`

*   Fixed a small bug in `to_camel_case()` in the `xx_string` module:<br>
    Previously, it would return only the first part of the decomposed string.<br>
    Now it correctly returns all decomposed string parts, joined in CamelCase.


<span id="v1-5-9" />

## 21.12.2024 `v1.5.9`

*   Fixed bugs in method `to_ansi()` in module `xx_format_codes`:<br>
    1.  The method always returned an empty string because the color validation was broken, and it would identify all colors as invalid.<br>
        Now the validation `Color.is_valid_rgba()` and `Color.is_valid_hexa()` are fixed, and now, if a color is identified as invalid, the method returns the original string instead of an empty string.
    2.  Previously the method `to_ansi()` couldn't handle formats inside `[]` because everything inside the brackets was recognized as an invalid format.<br>
        Now you can use formats inside `[]` (e.g., `"[[red](Red text [b](inside) square brackets!)]"`).
*   Introduced a new test for the `xx_format_codes` module.
*   Fixed a small bug in the help client command:<br>
    Added back the default text color.


<span id="v1-5-8" />

## 21.11.2024 `v1.5.8`

*   Added method `String.is_empty()` to check if the string is empty.
*   Added method `String.escape()` to escape special characters in a string.
*   Introduced a new test for `xx_data` (all methods).
*   Added docstrings to all the methods in `xx_data`.
*   Made all the methods from `xx_data` work with all the types of data structures (lists, tuples, sets, frozensets, and dicts).
*   Added method `EnvPath.remove_path()`.
*   Introduced a new test for `xx_env_vars` (all methods).
*   Added a `hexa_str()` preset to the `xx_regex` module.
*   Introduced a new test for the methods from the `Color` class in `xx_color`.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Renamed the library from `XulbuX` to `xulbux` for better naming conventions.
*   Renamed the module `xx_cmd` and its class `Cmd` to `xx_console` and `Console`.
*   Renamed the module `xx_env_vars` and its class `EnvVars` to `xx_env_path` and `EnvPath`.


<span id="v1-5-7" />

## 15.11.2024 `v1.5.7`

*   Change the testing modules to be able to run together with the library `pytest`.
*   Added formatting checks, using `black`, `isort` and `flake8`.
*   Added the script (command) `xx-help` or `xulbux-help`.
*   Structured `Cmd.restricted_input()` a bit nicer so it appears less complex.
*   Corrected code after `Lint with flake8` formatting suggestions.
*   Added additional tests for the custom color types.
*   Updated the whole `xx_format_codes` module for more efficiency and speed.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Moved the `help()` function to the file `_cli_.py`, because that's where all the scripts are located (and renamed it to `help_command()`).
*   Moved the method `normalize_spaces()` to `xx_string`.


<span id="v1-5-6" />

## 11.11.2024 `v1.5.6`

**Again 𝓢𝓲𝓷𝓰𝓵𝓮𝓼 𝓓𝓪𝔂 🥇😉**

*   Moved the whole library to a separate repository: **[python-lib-xulbux](https://github.com/xulbux/python-lib-xulbux)**
*   Updated all connections and links correspondingly.


<span id="v1-5-5" />

## 11.11.2024 `v1.5.5`

**𝓢𝓲𝓷𝓰𝓵𝓮𝓼 𝓓𝓪𝔂 🥇😉**

*   Added methods to get the width and height of the console (in characters and lines):<br>
    -   `Cmd.w() -> int` – How many text characters the console is wide.<br>
    -   `Cmd.h() -> int` – How many lines the console is high.<br>
    -   `Cmd.wh() -> tuple[int, int]` – A tuple with width and height.
*   Added the method `split_count(string, count) -> list[str]` to `xx_string`.
*   Added docstrings to every method in `xx_string`.
*   Updated the `Cmd.restricted_input()` method to be able to:
    -   paste text from the clipboard,
    -   select all text to delete everything at once,
    -   write and backspace over multiple lines and
    -   support custom formatting codes in the prompt.
*   Added required non-standard libraries to the project file.
*   Added more metadata to the project file.


<span id="v1-5-4" />

## 06.11.2024 `v1.5.4`

*   Added a new method `normalize_spaces(code) -> str` to `Code`.
*   Added new docstrings to `xx_code` and `xx_cmd`.
*   Added a custom `input()` method to `Cmd`, which lets you specify the allowed text characters the user can type, as well as the minimum and maximum length of the input.
*   Added the method `pwd_input()` to `Cmd`, which works just like the `Cmd.restricted_input()` but masks the input characters with `*`.
*   Restructured the whole library's imports so the custom types won't get displayed as `Any` when hovering over a method/function.
*   Fixed a bug when trying to get the base directory from a compiled script (EXE):<br>
    Would previously get the path to the temporary extracted directory, which is created when running the EXE file.<br>
    Now it gets the actual base directory of the currently running file.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Made the `blend()` method from all the color types modify the *`self`* object in addition to returning the result.


<span id="v1-5-3" />

## 30.10.2024 `v1.5.3`

*   Added the default text color to the `_consts_.py` so it's easier to change it (and used it in the library).
*   Added several other default colors to the `_consts_.py` (and used them in the library).
*   Refactored the whole library's code after the **[PEPs](https://peps.python.org)** and **[The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python)** 🫡:
    -   Changed the indent to 4 spaces.
    -   No more inline control statements.
*   Added new methods to `Color`:<br>
    -   `rgba_to_hex(r, g, b, a) -> int`<br>
    -   `hex_to_rgba(hex_int) -> tuple`<br>
    -   `luminance(r, g, b, precision, round_to) -> float | int`
*   Fixed the `grayscale()` method of `rgba()`, `hsla()` and `hexa()`:<br>
    The method would previously just return the color, fully desaturated (not grayscale).<br>
    Now this is fixed, and the method uses the luminance formula to get the actual grayscale value.
*   All the methods in the `xx_color` module now support hex integers (e.g., `0x8085FF` instead of only strings: `"#8085FF"` `"0x8085FF"`).

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Restructured the values in `_consts_.py`.


<span id="v1-5-2" />

## 28.10.2024 `v1.5.2`

*   New parameter `correct_path: bool` in `Path.extend()`:
    This makes sure that typos in the path will only be corrected if this parameter is true.
*   Fixed a bug in `Path.extend()`, where an empty string was taken as a valid path for the current directory `./`.
*   Fixed color validation bug:<br>
    `Color.is_valid_rgba()` and `Color.is_valid_hsla()` would not accept an alpha channel of `None`.<br>
    `Color.is_valid_rgba()` was still checking for an alpha channel from `0` to `255` instead of `0` to `1`.
*   Fixed a bug for `Color.has_alpha()`:<br>
    Previously, it would return `True` if the alpha channel was `None`.<br>
    Now in such cases it will return `False`.


<span id="v1-5-1" />

## 28.10.2024 `v1.5.1`

*   Now all methods in `xx_color` support both hex prefixes (`#` and `0x`).
*   Added the default hex prefix to `_consts_.py`.
*   Fixed a bug when initializing a `hexa()` object:<br>
    Would throw an error, even if the color was valid.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Renamed all library files for a better naming convention.


<span id="v1-5-0" />

## 27.10.2024 `v1.5.0` Big Update 🚀

*   Added a `__help__.py` file, which will show some information about the library and how to use it when it's run as a script or when the `help()` function is called.
*   Added a lot more metadata to the library:<br>
    `__version__` (was already added in update [v1.4.2](#v1-4-2))<br>
    `__author__`<br>
    `__email__`<br>

<span id="v1-2-4" /><span id="v1-2-5" />

## 18.10.2024 `v1.2.4` `v1.2.5`

*   Added more info to the `README.md` as well as additional links.
*   Adjusted the structure inside `CHANGELOG.md` for a better overview and readability.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Renamed the class `rgb()` to `rgba()` to communicate more clearly that it supports an alpha channel.
*   Renamed the class `hsl()` to `hsla()` to communicate more clearly that it supports an alpha channel.


<span id="v1-2-3" />

## 18.10.2024 `v1.2.3`

*   Added project links to the Python-project-file.
*   Made some `CHANGELOG.md` improvements.

<span id="v1-2-1" /><span id="v1-2-2" />

## 18.10.2024 `v1.2.1` `v1.2.2`

*   Fixed a bug in the method `Path.get(base_dir=True)`:<br>
    Previously, setting `base_dir` to `True` would not return the actual base directory or even cause an error.<br>
    Setting `base_dir` to `True` now will return the actual base directory of the current program (except if not running from a file).


<span id="v1-2-0" />

## 17.10.2024 `v1.2.0`

*   New method in the `Path` class:<br>
    `Path.remove()`


<span id="v1-1-9" />

<span id="v1-1-1" /><span id="v1-1-2" />

## 17.10.2024 `v1.1.1` `v1.1.2`

*   Adjusted the library's description.


<span id="v1-1-0" />

## 16.10.2024 `v1.1.0`

*   Made it possible to also auto-reset the color and not only the predefined formats, using the [auto-reset-format](#auto-reset-format) (`[format](Automatically resetting)`).


<span id="v1-0-9" />

## 16.10.2024 `v1.0.9`

*   Added a library description, which gets shown if the library base import is run directly.
*   Made it possible to escape an <span id="auto-reset-format">auto-reset-format</span> (`[format](Automatically resetting)`) with a slash, so you can still have `()` brackets behind a `[format]`:

    ```python
    FormatCodes.print("[u](Automatically resetting) following text")
    ```

    prints: <code><u>Automatically resetting</u> following text</code>

    ```python
    FormatCodes.print("[u]/(Automatically resetting) following text")
    ```

    prints: <code><u>(Automatically resetting) following text</u></code>


<span id="v1-0-7" /><span id="v1-0-8" />

## 16.10.2024 `v1.0.7` `v1.0.8`

*   Added an `input()` method to the `FormatCodes` class so you can make pretty-looking input prompts.
*   Added a warning for no network connection when trying to [install missing libraries](#improved-lib-importing).


<span id="v1-0-6" />

## 15.10.2024 `v1.0.6`

*   <span id="improved-lib-importing">Improved **$\color{#8085FF}\textsf{XulbuX}$** library importing:</span><br>
    Checks for missing required libraries and gives you the option to directly install them, if there are any.
*   Fixed issue where configuration file wasn't created and loaded correctly.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

*   Moved constant variables into a separate file.


<span id="v1-0-1" /><span id="v1-0-2" /><span id="v1-0-3" /><span id="v1-0-4" /><span id="v1-0-5" />

## 15.10.2024 `v1.0.1` `v1.0.2` `v1.0.3` `v1.0.4` `v1.0.5`

*   Fixed `f-string` issues for Python 3.10:
    1.  Not making use of the same quotes inside f-strings anymore.
    2.  No backslash escaping in f-strings.
